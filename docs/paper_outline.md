## Abstract (by chatty)

## Introduction

LLM too powerful for text related tasks

AI Agents are a great way to automate mundane tasks (e.g.)

Accesibility is a problem as people do not have a great way to use them effectively

Can do administrative tasks pretty good and there exists a lot of tasks that are repetivie such as filling forms with IDs, etc. It can be done autonamted to reduce the time it takes for employees

Accessbility solved with email (tool most used by administrative employees).

This paper we propose a proof of concept and architecture where email and ai agents are combined to solve administrative tasks. We will show an agent that will receive PDF forms and details and will response an email to the employee with the forms filled. The body of the email will act as a prompt and the attachments will act as a RAG, blabla.

## Methodology

Architecture proposed

Block diagram (code)

- Email Client
- OCR
- LLM
- Python

## Proof of concept

### 1. email form

### 2. autonomo

### 3. generic (exam, look in the internet or try to fill the forms)

## Results

Examples of the code

(measure latency) for the results vs typing speed of human
(measure price) for results

## Conclusions

### Future work

- Specialized agents (medicine, law, education, etc.)
- More type of docs (docx, pptx)
